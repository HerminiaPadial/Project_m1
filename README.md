**Where is my bike?**

It is a pilot project that aims to allow users to find the nearest BICIMAD station to a specific place. 
In this first version, much more limited, the selected places have been the cultural centers of Madrid. It only allows the user to know the BICIMAD station closest to them, so the user will be able to know where to find the nearest BICIMAD station.
